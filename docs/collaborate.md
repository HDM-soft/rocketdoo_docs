# How to collaborate in this project?

This project has been created with much more passion and desire to provide a valuable tool for the Odoo developer, than with strong Python programming skills.

That's why we consider that any suggestion of improvement or contribution to the functionalities of this Framework,
are not only welcome, but we are also inviting those who wish to contribute
to help this Framework keep growing, have a place in **ROCKETDOO**.
----------------------------------------------------

To be able to contribute with improvements in the **ROCKETDOO** repository it is necessary that you make a FORK to the
repo, and after that every contribution must be done in a new branch with description of the change you want to make and contribute;
following the conventions and good practices in the creation of branches. That is to say
using prefixes to define the change you want to make.

Example:

* FEAT: (for new features)
* UPD: (upgrade)
* FIX: (fix a bug)
* WIP: (work in progress)
* DEL: (remove some functionality or part of the code)
And so on with every action and change to be made.

Keep in mind also that once the change is done, it is necessary to make a commit with a description in order to make a Pull Request.

The PR must be approved, after reviewing the code and the detailed description of the developer to the branch
developer's code and then we have to merge them to the *develop* branch to get a test about this change and, if
the change it's aproved, after that make a merge to the *main* branch.
